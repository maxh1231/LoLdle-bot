# Want to Contribute?

- Fork repository.
- Submit Pull Requests to upstream's `develop` branch.

## Guidelines

### Branching

Any anticipated change to the codebase ideally will have an associated issue. Branches should include the issue number and a descriptive title that follows the format:

`<issue number>-<title>`

Ex. #31 win detection not consistent:

`31-windetection`

If corresponding issue doesn't exist:

`NA-windetection`

**_Note:_** Ultimately you can't go wrong with branch naming. Contributors are heavily encouraged and their contributions won't be rejected due a branch name.
